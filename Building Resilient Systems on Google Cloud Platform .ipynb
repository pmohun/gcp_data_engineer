    "- Find the \"GetMessages\" pipeline step in the graph, and then find the corresponding code in the AverageSpeeds.java file. This is the pipeline step that reads from the Pub/Sub topic. It creates a collection of Strings - which corresponds to Pub/Sub messages that have been read.\n",
    "- Do you see a subscription created?\n",
    "- How does the code pull messages from Pub/Sub?\n",
    "- Find the \"Time Window\" pipeline step in the graph and in code. In this pipeline step we create a window of a duration specified in the pipeline parameters (sliding window in this case). This window will accumulate the traffic data from the previous step until end of window, and pass it to the next steps for further transforms.\n",
    "- What is the window interval?\n",
    "- How often is a new window created?\n",
    "- Find the \"BySensor\" and \"AvgBySensor\" pipeline steps in the graph, and then find the corresponding code snippet in the AverageSpeeds.java file. This \"BySensor\" does a grouping of all events in the window by sensor id, while \"AvgBySensor\" will then compute the mean speed for each grouping.\n",
    "- Find the \"ToBQRow\" pipeline step in the graph and in code. This step simply creates a \"row\" with the average computed from previous step together with the lane information.\n",
    "- In practice, other actions could be taken in the ToBQRow step. For example, it could compare the calculated mean against a predefined threshold and log the results of the comparison in Stackdriver Logging.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Find the \"BigQueryIO.Write\" in both the pipeline graph and in the source code. This step writes the row out of the pipeline into a BigQuery table. Because we chose the WriteDisposition.WRITE_APPEND write disposition, new records will be appended to the table.\n",
    "- Return to the BigQuery web UI tab Or open it from the Navigation menu () click BigQuery. Refresh your browser.\n",
    "- In the left column, beneath the text box, find your project name and the demos dataset you created. The small blue arrow to the left should now be active and clicking on it will reveal the average_speeds table. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Task 6: Determine throughput rates\n",
    "- Return to the browser tab for Console. On the Navigation menu () click Dataflow and click on your job to monitor progress (it will have your username in the pipeline name).\n",
    "- Select the \"GetMessages\" pipeline node in the graph and look at the step metrics on the right.\n",
    "- System Lag is an important metric for streaming pipelines. It represents the amount of time data elements are waiting to be processed since they \"arrived\" in the input of the transformation step.\n",
    "- Elements Added metric under output collections tells you how many data elements exited this step (for the \"Read PubSub Msg\" step of the pipeline it also represents the number of Pub/Sub messages read from the topic by the Pub/Sub IO connector).\n",
    "- Select the \"Time Window\" node in the graph. Observe how the Elements Added metric under the Input Collections of the \"Time -Window\" step matches the Elements Added metric under the Output Collections of the previous step \"GetMessages\".\n",

    "- Click on \"See more history\" and review how many workers were used at different points in time during pipeline execution.\n",
    "- The data from a traffic sensor simulator started at the beginning of the lab creates hundreds of messages per second in the Pub/Sub topic. This will cause Dataflow to increase the number of workers to keep the system lag of the pipeline at optimal levels.\n",
    "- Click on See more history. In the Worker History pop-up, you can see how Dataflow changed the number of workers. Notice the Rationale column that explains the reason for the change.\n",

    "#### Task 9: Refresh the sensor data simulation script\n",
    "- Return to the training_vm SSH terminal where the sensor data is script is running.\n",
